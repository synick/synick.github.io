![lukasz-circle.png](/assets/images/lukasz-circle.png)
Lukasz is the Head of Assurance at Context Information Security and one of the co-founders of TuskCon, Australia’s most disorganised conference on the beach. He regularly presents at various conferences around Australia and New Zealand and when he isn’t herding pentesters, you can find him building something useless in his woodworking shop.
