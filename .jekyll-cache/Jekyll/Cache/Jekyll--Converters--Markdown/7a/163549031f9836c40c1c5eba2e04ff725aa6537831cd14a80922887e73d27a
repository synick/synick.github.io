<p>Lukasz is the Head of Assurance at Context Information Security and one of the co-founders of TuskCon, Australiaâ€™s most disorganised conference on the beach. He regularly presents at various conferences around Australia and New Zealand and when he isnâ€™t herding pentesters, you can find him building something useless in his woodworking shop.</p>
